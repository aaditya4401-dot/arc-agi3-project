"""Animation awareness.

``arcengine`` renders a frame after every internal ``step()``, so a single
action can come back as a short animation. ``GameState.frame`` is only the last
of those, and the harness consumed nothing else - so every intermediate frame
was discarded before the agent could see it. On some games the whole effect of
an action lives there: the board before and the board after are identical, and
reading the final frame cannot possibly reveal what happened.

Two shapes occur. Where cells change and change BACK, the information is
genuinely hidden and worth spending prompt tokens on. Where every cell changes
at most once, the frames are motion interpolation toward a state the final
frame already shows, and there is nothing to find - those animations are
reported nowhere, because a line about them would cost tokens to say that
nothing is missing.

# Why a diff timeline rather than the frames themselves: one 64x64 grid renders
# as roughly 4,100 characters, and a single action can return dozens of frames.
# Whole frames are never affordable against a ~1,024-token tool budget, so
# retrieval collapses identical frames and reports only the cells that changed
# between the rest. A single frame can still be read verbatim, cropped.
# No step limit: the timeline crosses the pipe as data and the model prints
# only what it chooses, so dropping steps served a prompt budget that no longer
# applies. It also cost a real misreading - a step count reported as omitted
# was read as "those steps had no changes", the exact inverse.
